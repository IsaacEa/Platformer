In order to beat the game you have to obtain all the keys to open the door and get to the next level. When the player touches a key, it is destroyed and it increaes a variable by 1. When this variable reaches 3, the door is opened and the player can enter the next level. The player have a certain number of lifes that can decrease whenever they touch an enemy, dying if this number reaches 0.
