# Platformer
A little 3 level-platformer I did for homework to learn and practice Unity programming.

In order to beat the game you have to obtain all the keys to open the door and get to the next level. When the player touches a key, it is destroyed and it increaes a variable by 1. When this variable reaches 3, the door is opened and the player can enter the next level. The player have a certain number of lifes that can decrease whenever they touch an enemy, dying if this number reaches 0.

Enemy movement:

This way the enemies will move from side to side.



Code that controlls lifes and destruction of objects:
